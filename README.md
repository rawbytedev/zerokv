# DBModel

A complete interface to unifie all different Golang Databases, from memory databases to on disk databases and network

It provides a complete interface so the code stays clean and to avoid excessive types for IO operation
The core value is freedom of implementation, you can tweak settings and implementations how you like it
we only provide simple interface and it's up to you to customize it to you're need, or you can make use 
of already in place implementations
